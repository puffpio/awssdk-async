This is a fork of the official Amazon Web Service Software Development Kit (AWSSDK) for .Net

Maintained by David Pio (david@puffpio.com)

There are two major objectives:
1) Update the library to .Net 4
2) Provide nonblocking asynchronous versions of the API methods

To build this library, it requires .Net 4 and the Visual Studio Async CTP: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/async.aspx
However, when deploying the binary, the Async CTP shouldn't be required to be installed, just need to include the AsyncCtpLibrary dll

Already async'd:
